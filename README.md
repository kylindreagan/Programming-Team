# College Programming Team Archive

## Overview
Welcome to my **college programming team archive**! :>
This repository contains the code, solutions, and notes from my years participating in competitive programming and team projects. It’s meant to showcase my growth, problem-solving skills, and experience tackling a wide variety of algorithmic challenges.

The content spans multiple languages (mostly python), paradigms, and problem types—from **data structures and algorithms** to **optimization and system design exercises**.

---

## Motivation
During my time on the team, I aimed to:  
- Sharpen my **algorithmic thinking** and **coding efficiency**.  
- Tackle a broad spectrum of problems, including graphs, dynamic programming, combinatorics, and more.  
- Collaborate with teammates and learn **team-based problem-solving techniques**.  
- Build a **personal archive** of reusable code and patterns for future reference.  

---

## Notes
- Some solutions reflect team collaboration, so coding style may vary between files.

- This repo is meant for educational purposes, sharing techniques, patterns, and inspiration for learning algorithms.
